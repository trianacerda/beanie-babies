| `BeanieBany({ beanieBaby })` : takes in the correct props and renders `Link` components to the detail page |1|
| `BeaniesList({ beanieBabies })` : takes in the correct props and renders a `BeanieBaby` for each item in the array |1|
| `BeaniesPage` : tracks beanieBabies and page state correctly, refetching whenever the page state changes, passes props correctly to `BeaniesList` |1|
| `BeanieDetail` : uses the correct `react-router-dom` hook to get the id from the URL, then uses that id to fetch the correct beanie baby |1|

### Stretch goal ideas
- Add a search bar. Initially, just launch a new search on change using your `useEffect`. Ideally, though, this search should occur on submit. Ooooor you can look into throttling/debouncing your function call to limit the number of calls that are made on change!
- Add search params to the URL on change. That way you can copy and paste link to the exact right search and send it to somebody else. You'll need to use the query params to set the initial state of your current page and search query
